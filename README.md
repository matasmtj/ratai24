# 🚘 Car Rental, Leasing & Sales Platform

This project aims to simplify the manual process of creating rental agreements while helping businesses promote their vehicles online. It provides a convenient and transparent way for users to browse, rent, and eventually buy cars they enjoy driving.

# 🌟 Overview

Guests can freely explore the list of available cars, view detailed information such as specifications, photos, and rental prices.
If a vehicle interests them, they can register or log in to access additional features such as checking available dates and submitting a rental request.

Once the request is submitted, an administrator reviews and approves the reservation.
After approval, the user simply visits the physical car lot to sign the agreement and pick up the car.

# 🚗 Future Vision

The system will evolve beyond standard car rentals into a hybrid rental–purchase platform, allowing customers to buy the car they’ve rented if they fall in love with it — essentially offering an extended test drive experience.

In addition, the project plans to include a car parts marketplace, where users can:

Purchase used parts directly from the business,

Or order new parts from partner stores through our integrated outsourcing system.

This way, the platform will serve as a complete automotive ecosystem — combining car rentals, sales, and spare parts in one unified place.

# 💡 Key Goals

Simplify and digitize the car rental reservation process.

Help car rental businesses reach more customers online.
