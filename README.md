CarLease — Project Overview
1. Description of the Problem Being Solved
1.1 System Purpose

The goal of this project is to streamline the manual process of creating car rental reservation agreements and help the business with promotion.

A guest can browse the list of cars and see details with pricing.

If a vehicle suits them, the user registers or logs in to view available dates and submit a rental request.

An administrator can then approve the reservation, after which the user arrives at the physical lot to sign the contract and pick up the car.
